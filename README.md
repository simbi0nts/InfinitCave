# InfinitCave

Procedural generated game.

Genre: roguelike

Main features of this game at the moment:

* Procedural generated cave (number of floors, length and width of caves can be manually configured in config.py file)
* Dynamic light (still shameless, but interesting)
* Some kind of enemies
* Very fast walls rendering 
* Power-ups, that helps not ot die too early (anyway, there still no chacne to survive)

What I want to do in future releases:

* Weapons
* Bosses
* Chance to complete the game
* Cool Story
* Game Balance

It's still just a little game, but already have my favourite bugs
